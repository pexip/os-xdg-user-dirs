Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.
